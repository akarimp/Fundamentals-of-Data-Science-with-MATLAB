    "\n",
    "In this chapter, the basics of programming with the MATLAB language are\n",
    "described. First, MATLAB syntax style is explained. Then, MATLAB\n",
    "built-in functions, add-on toolboxes, and third-party packages are\n",
    "described. After that, mathematical, comparison, and logical operators\n",
    "are presented. Next, integer, floating point, and complex numbers are\n",
    "described. Then, it is explained how to work with strings. It follows by\n",
    "descriptions of the vector creation. After that, the if, for and while\n",
    "statements are explained. Next, it is described how to define a\n",
    "function. Then, it is demonstrated how to use a tilde. At the end, it is\n",
    "explained how to work with files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 MATLAB Syntax Style\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB syntax follows sets of standard styles and layouts. Probably, the\n",
    "most distinctive principle of the MATLAB code layout is its use of the\n",
    "end keyword to define a block of code. In MATLAB, the end keyword is\n",
    "used to mark and define each block of code from other blocks in rest of\n",
    "the code. Every new block of code should finish with the end keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another principle of the MATLAB code layout is that it ignores an\n",
    "indentation. In simple words, indentation is a blank space at the start\n",
    "of each line in a code, which means to start a new line of code further\n",
    "in the left compared with a previous line. In MATLAB, an indentation may\n",
    "be used to structure a code to visually separate each block of code from\n",
    "other blocks in rest of the code. Every time a new block of code is\n",
    "about to start, it can be indented to the left (its lines start further\n",
    "in left) compared with lines in a previous block. In MATLAB, an\n",
    "indentation may be used to structure a code to make it more readable,\n",
    "however, MATLAB does not require it and treats both indented and\n",
    "non-indented code the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB may not suggest limiting each line of code to a specific number\n",
    "of characters, however, it is a good practice to split a long line of\n",
    "code into two or more lines. In MATLAB, an ellipsis, ..., is used for a\n",
    "line continuation (a line break). In general, any line of MATLAB code\n",
    "(regardless of its length) can be split into two or more lines by using\n",
    "an ellipsis at the end of each line. Here is an example of how to use an\n",
    "ellipsis for a line continuation. In this example, integers from 1 to 10\n",
    "are added together."

    "In MATLAB, it is possible to split a code into a series of sections. To\n",
    "do that, double percent signs, %%, are used at the start of the line\n",

    "to divide a code into a series of groups as each group serves a specific\n",
    "goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common syntax style is to use a semicolon at the end of a code\n",
    "line. Every time a MATLAB syntax is run, MATLAB shows outputs at a\n",
    "command window. To stop MATLAB showing results from a line of a code in\n",
    "a command window, a semicolon, ; , should be used at the end of that\n",
    "line. This is particularly helpful when a MATLAB script file is\n",
    "executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB has specific naming rules for variable names. Here are rules that\n",
    "variable names should follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Variable names can consist of letters (both uppercase, A-Z, and\n",
    "    lowercase, a-z), digits (0-9), and an underscore character (\\_).\n",
    "-   A variable name length should be limited to a number that the\n",
    "    namelengthmax command returns.\n",
    "-   Variable names should start with a letter. Variable names cannot\n",
    "    start with a digit or underscore, \\_.\n",
    "-   The rest of a variable name, i.e. a part that comes after the first\n",
    "    character, can consist of letters, digits, and underscores.\n",
    "-   Variable names cannot be the same as MATLAB keywords. To check if a\n",
    "    name is a MATLAB keyword, the iskeyword('...') command may be used.\n",
    "    The iskeyword command returns all MATLAB keywords.\n",
    "-   Variable names are case sensitive. For example, age=60 and Age=60\n",
    "    are considered as two separate variables. Although it is allowed to\n",
    "    use both age and Age as a variable name, it is highly recommended to\n",
    "    avoid using both of them in the same code.\n",
    "-   Space is not allowed in variable names. Therefore, space cannot be\n",
    "    used between parts of a compound name. To split a variable name into\n",
    "    two or more parts, use an underscore character, \\_, between parts\n",
    "    (This practice is known as snake case). For example, best age=25 is\n",
    "    not correct. Some acceptable alternatives are: best_age=25, or\n",
    "    bestage=25, or BestAge=25, or any other combination without a space.\n",
    "-   It is suggested to avoid using the same name for variables and\n",
    "    functions, particularly in the same script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 MATLAB Built-in Functions, Add-on Toolboxes, and Third-Party Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB comes with a large number of built-in functions. All built-in\n",
    "functions are loaded at the moment MATLAB starts and become available to\n",
    "use. Here are some of the MATLAB built-in functions: abs, clear, length,\n",
    "max, min, and disp.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to built-in functions, MATLAB has a list of add-on toolboxes\n",
    "that may be acquired separately. To use any of the toolboxes, its\n",
    "license should be obtained first. Any of these toolboxes includes a\n",
    "series of functions which developed to conduct specific tasks. After a\n",
    "toolbox is obtained, all associated functions in that toolbox become\n",
    "available to use. Some of the MATLAB toolboxes are: Curve Fitting\n",
    "Toolbox, Data Acquisition Toolbox, Image Processing Toolbox, Mapping\n",
    "Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox, Parallel Computing Toolbox, and Signal\n",
    "Processing Toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to built-in functions, MATLAB comes with pre-defined constants.\n",
    "The most commonly used MATLAB built-in constants are eps, pi, and NaN.\n",
    "Also, MATLAB has a series of keywords such as if, for, and while.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are tons of popular third-party packages for MATLAB.\n",
    "Unlike the built-in functions that come pre-installed with MATLAB, the\n",
    "third-party packages need to be added manually after MATLAB is\n",
    "installed. To use the third-party package, it should be downloaded and\n",
    "stored on a system. If a packaged is zipped, it should be unzipped\n",
    "first. Now, to use this package, MATLAB needs to know where to look for\n",
    "this new package. For that purpose, a folder that contains this package\n",
    "should be added to the MATLAB search path. A folder can be added to the\n",
    "MATLAB search path by using the addpath command. Each package might have\n",
    "its own installation instruction that users should follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Mathematical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB has a series of arithmetic operators. When MATLAB starts, these\n",
    "mathematical operators are available to use right away. However, there\n",
    "are other operators or functions that are only available through add-on\n",
    "toolboxes. For example, a plus operator, +, is always available to use,\n",
    "while the periodogram function which estimates a power spectral density,\n",
    "is only available through the Signal Processing Toolbox (Although it\n",
    "might be obtained from the third-party packages as well). Therefore, to\n",
    "use the periodogram function, the Signal Processing Toolbox should be\n",
    "obtained first.\n",

    "operation and a matrix operation. An array operation is used for\n",

    "matrix manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of arithmetic operations is array operations, which is\n",
    "used for numerical operations. For example, 2\\*3 is a simple numerical\n",
    "manipulation. As another example for an array operation, consider\n",
    "matrixes A and a scaler 2. Now, the A\\*2 expression multiplies all\n",
    "elements of matrix A by 2. Similarly, A/2 divides all elements of matrix\n",
    "A by 2, the A+2 adds 2 to all elements of matrix A, and the A-2\n",
    "subtracts 2 from all elements of matrix A. However, 2/A causes an error,\n",
    "as we cannot divide a number by a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another situation that an array operation might be used is in\n",
    "computations that element by element (element-wise) operations are\n",
    "required. For example, consider the same-size matrixes B and C. Now,\n",
    "assume a case that we need to multiply all elements in a matrix B by\n",
    "their corresponding elements in a matrix C. To do that we can use B.\\*C\n",
    "expression. Similarly, B./C divides all elements of a matrix B by their\n",
    "corresponding elements in a matrix C. Here, the period character, .,\n",
    "instructs MATLAB to use array operations rather than matrix operations.\n",
    "As array and matrix operations for + and - are the same, there is no\n",
    "need to use a period before them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that a 2/A expression causes an error, however, the 2./A\n",
    "divides 2 by all elements of matrix A. Similarly, the A^2 causes an\n",
    "error, however, the A.^2 raises all elements of matrix A to the power of\n",
    "2. Note that, A.\\*2 is the same as A\\*2 and A./2 is the same as A/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of arithmetic operations is matrix operations, which is\n",
    "used for matrix manipulations. For example, consider matrixes D and F\n",
    "with compatible sizes. The D\\*F expression multiplies a matrix D by a\n",
    "matrix F, the D/F divides a matrix D by a matrix F, the D+F adds a\n",
    "matrix D and a matrix F, the D-F subtract a matrix D from a matrix F.\n",
